This is the basic apache (httpd) kickstart file for any webserver.

We do not enable SSL by default as we don't want to generate 
self-signed certificates as that might be undesirable.

In a future version of CLIP we plan to add support for Let's Encrypt
which will automate the process of getting CA-signed certs for free!
If you want to try it now visit this link:

Follow the instructions hwere to generate a self-signed certificate:
https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Https

NOTE: anytime those steps tell you to restart a service, pre-pend "run_init"
to the beginning of the command. CLIP's strict policy won't allow you to 
directly restart services.

Please enable HTTPS and disable unencrypted HTTP after you generate or
purchase certificates:
