1. Using AWS: If you generate a VPN variant for use in AWS, a SSH public key
will be added to the users on the VPN automatically. This is the 
from the key pair you generated in the AWS web interface when
instantiating a VM from the AMI.

2. Not using AWS: if you are not using AWS you must add public keys to the
the system manually. Login to the console as toor and add keys to
/home/vpn/.ssh/authorized_keys and /home/sftp/.ssh/authorized_keys
Then run:
restorecon -RF /home 

3 Both AWS and non-AWS: once the system has booted ssh into the system as
the 'vpn' user. Enter a "1" to generate IKE v1 certificatess or "2" to
generate IKE v2 certificates. Press ctrl-c.

4. SFTP into the system as the 'sftp' user. Download the generated
certificates.

NOTE: this assumes you haven't changed any of the user names in the 
kickstart.

5. Configure your client to use the downloaded certificates and 
setup the client to connect to the VPN server. Connect and enjoy!
