To enable GUI support:

1. Update CONFIG_BUILD and set this to "y"
CONFIG_BUILD_ENABLE_GUI=y

Then, you need to make sure your kickstart
has "%include includes/gui-config" immediately
after %include includes/fix-bad-scap. That
chunk should now look something like:

%include includes/fix-bad-scap
%include includes/gui-config
%include includes/late-scap-audit
%include includes/set-enforcement-mode

There is a second flag in CONFIG_BUILD,
CONFIG_BUILD_BREAK_GUI. If set to "y", riskier
actions are tkaen that might break random things
in X in favor of enhancing the security posture
of the system, like forcibly removing bluetooth
packages and ignoring dependencies while doing
so. Use this flag carefully and if things break,
try setting it to "no" to see if the problem is
resolved. Then you can visit kickstart/includes/gui-config
and try to track down what action broke things.
