Important notes:

Packages:
1. We have removed a number of packages that would normall be installed in a GUI config, including 
packages that provide the "classic" theme which is the default in RHEL 7. Thus, you will see the default,
unthemed GNOME Shell interface.

2. If you enabled the CONFIG_BUILD_BREAK_GUI
feature, some packages were forcibly removed. This
might very well break things. When you encounter
a problem, try disabling this flag before you spend
too much time investigating the issue.

3. Unfortunately, some packages can't be removed that we
really want to remove, like GNOME Online Accounts
which can manage online accounts like Goole and Facebook.
GDM has a hard dependency on this package and won't start
if it is missing.

4. We removed a bunch of fonts to keep
the ISO size down and perhaps mitigate
rendering bugs.

Security:
1. We apply the normal dconf/gsettings lockdowns. Checkout /etc/dconf/db/local.d/locks/settings
for a complete list of the locks we put in-place and /etc/dconf/db/local.d/* for the settings we
have applied before inserting the locks.

2. We have left user extensions enabled
which is apparently required to load system-level extensions (weird right?). However,
the extensions that can be loaded are still somewhat controlled by enabled-extensions
dconf setting and accompanying lock.

SELinux:

If you look at the audit logs after booting a GUI configuration of CLIP, you will notice a dbus denial. The denial
is from a location service called geoclue. The geoclue_t domain attempts to provide those location services via dbus
service org.freedesktop.GeoClue2, which can be seen by running 'ausearch -m user_avc'. Specifically it is trying to
"acuire_svc" on that identifier.

In SELinux, if no specific label is applied to a service name, the service defaults to system_dbusd_t. Thus,
if it was permitted to do this, geoclue's service would have all the permissions associated with the system
dbus service provider, which is not desirable.
 
Our approach to dbus is that every single dbus service should have a specific label in dbus_contexts.
If there is no specific label there, things get system_dbusd_t permission denials. But we don't want anyone
to accidentally grant access to that type, so this assertion is in-place to prevent users from accidentally doing that.

If you don't know what all this means, here is an example entry from config/appconfig-mcs/dbus_contexts:
       <associate
       own="org.freedesktop.NetworkManager"
       context="system_u:object_r:NetworkManager_t:s0"/>

This says that any access to the org.freedesktop.NetworkManager service
will be checked against the NetworkManager_t type, This applies to both the
service provider who is performing acquire_service to provide the service,
and the clients who will be sending messages (send_msg) to the service.

Then you policy would look something like this:
allow networkmanager_t self:dbus acquire_svc;
allow staff_t networkmanager_t:dbus send_msg;

Remember: 'ausearch -m user_avc' will help identify the service name. 

Remember: you might not want to allow access to a service. If that is the
case you have two options:
1. Do nothing and live with the denial as doing nothing still prevents
any access to the service, like we have done with genclue.

2. Add a label for the service to dbus_contexts, but sitll grant
no access to that label.

Note about permissive mode:
In permissive mode you may see denials that only pop-up when certain actions
are allowed as a direct result of being in permissive mode. Sometimes, you should
*NOT* add rules based on those denials. An example is denials from login managers
and gettys on the password and shadow files. Normally, when access is denied, PAM
falls back to running helper applications to manipulate the files. However, if it
can, PAM tries to modify those files without using the helpers. Thus, in permissive
mode you will see denials for the login applications accessing types like oshadow_t, 
passwd_t, shadow_t, ...

Don't add access based on these denials. If it worked in enforcing, consider not
adding the rules just because they appear in permissive mode. You might actually
be compromising the security of the system.

Misc:
1. We forcibly remove gnome-control-center panels, so you
will notice errors in the logs indicating it attempted to load
a panel but the panel's desktop file was missing. These errors
can be ignored.

2. Look at kickstart/includes/gui-config and kickstart/includes/gui-packages
for all of the stuff we're doing for configuring the GUI. Ifg something is broken
these are the first two places to look. If you're looking at a deployed system,
look in /root/anaconda-ks.cfg and search for gnome_lock and conditional blocks controlled
by CONFIG_BUILD_ENABLE_GUI and CONFIG_BUILD_BREAK_GUI to review what was done to
configure the GUI during installation.

3. We have left the ability for the user to adjust network settings in-place. Similarly,
we have left the ability for the user to change Account Settings in-place. This is to strike
a balance between security and how the system works out of the box on a stock RHEL system.

You can disable certain things using GNOME extensions. CLIP contains a package called "clip-gnome-extensions"
that currently includes an extension to disable Account Settings. It is not enabled by default, but you can
add it to your kickstart to remove the Account Settings. You can also use the extension in that package as
a starting point for adding your own extensions.
