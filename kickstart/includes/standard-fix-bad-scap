# We have three approaches here:
# 1. don't fix things that are broken - obviously the wrong choice in general
# 2. fix it by shipping a custom profile that disables the broken stuff
# which is bad b/c then we're carrying custom profiles
# 3. fix it for now and wait until the tools make it easier to disable 
# individual checks and remedidation:
# https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap/issues/633
# We'll go with #3 and wait for the tools to catch up
